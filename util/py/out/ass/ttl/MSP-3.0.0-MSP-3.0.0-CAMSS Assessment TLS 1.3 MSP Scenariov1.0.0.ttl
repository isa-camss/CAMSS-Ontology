The biggest improvements are in the area of security, because a number of security risks are limited. This is because unsafe options from TLS 1.2 are excluded, SHA-1, RC4, DES, 3DES, AES-CBC and MD5, which reduces the chance of the protocol being configured in an unsafe manner. Configuration is also simpler, which means there is less chance of incorrect configuration

The process of creating an Internet Standard is straightforward: a specification undergoes a period of development and several iterations of review by the Internet community and revision based upon experience, is adopted as a Standard by the appropriate body... and is published. In practice, the process is more complicated, due to (1) the difficulty of creating specifications of high technical quality; (2) the need to consider the interests of all of the affected parties; (3) the importance of establishing widespread community consensus; and (4) the difficulty of evaluating the utility of a particular specification for the Internet community.

- prior implementation and testing;_x000D_
- clear, concise, and easily understood documentation;_x000D_
- openness and fairness; and _x000D_
- timeliness_x000D_
The goal of technical competence, the requirement for prior implementation and testing, and the need to allow all interested parties to comment all require significant time and effort. The Internet Standards Process is intended to balance these conflicting goals.

The IESG is responsible for technical management of IETF activities, the Internet standards process, and for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the Internet ''standards track'', including final approval of specifications as Internet Standards and publication as an RFC. Within each Area there are multiple Working Groups (WG). Each WG has one or more chairs who manage the work, and a written charter defining what the work is and when it is due. There are more than 100 WGs. The WGs produce Internet Drafts (I-Ds) which often lead to the publication of an Internet standard as an RFC._x000D_

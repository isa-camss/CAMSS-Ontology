To achieve this, interoperability between public administrations is a sine qua non condition.

XML addresses and facilitates interoperability between public administrations, cross border services and impacts positively the development of eGovernment. This is due to the fact that it has been designed  to store, transport data, and to exchange data through interoperable systems. Moreover, XML defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a human-readable format and machine-readable format enhancing the reusability of data and stimulating the interoperability of systems and services."

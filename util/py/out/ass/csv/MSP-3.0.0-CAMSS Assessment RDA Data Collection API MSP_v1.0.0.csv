• The Helmholtz Centre Potsdam (GFZ) has prototyped it for use in GEOFON to manage large numbers of overlapping seismological datasets https://github.com/javiquinte/datacoll
• The Perseids Project at Tufts University has used it to improve data sharing and annotation management http://collections.perseids.org/; https://github.com/RDACollectionsWG/perseids-manifold
• The Max Planck Computing and Data Facility (MPCDF) has included it in a generic data repository software https://github.com/TomZastrow/reptor
• The German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) has used the recommendation to deploy an operative service that enables data users to create custom research data collections (""data carts"") as part of the global Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF): https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/projects/esgf-dkrz/datacart_pid
While these are service providers for specific scientific research communities, the early adoption prototypes demonstrate that, in principle, service provisioning based on the specification is feasible and not bound to particular usage domains.

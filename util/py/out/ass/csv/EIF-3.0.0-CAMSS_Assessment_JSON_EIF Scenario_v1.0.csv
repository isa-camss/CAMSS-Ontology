The adoption of JSON fosters the publication of data as open data by means of providing structured data and the usage of non-proprietary formats. Moreover, it helps to link data by means of embedding metadata. 

Moreover, there is an existing extension of JSON which aims to help and support the Linked Open Data environments. The extension has been developed by the W3C working group specifically in charge of JSON-LD development. Additionally, the W3C has developed a syntax for RDF serialisation using JSON, and JSON-LD is recommended.

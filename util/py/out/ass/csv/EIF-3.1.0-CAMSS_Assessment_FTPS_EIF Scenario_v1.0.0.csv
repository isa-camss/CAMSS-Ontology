Each distinct version of an Internet standards-related specification is published as part of the ""Request for Comments"" (RFC) document series. This archival series is the official publication channel for Internet standards documents and other publications.
During the development of a specification, draft versions of the document are made available for informal review and comment by placing them in the IETF's ""Internet-Drafts"" directory, which is replicated on a number of Internet hosts. This makes an evolving working document readily available to a wide audience, facilitating the process of review and revision.

The process of creating an Internet Standard is straightforward: a specification undergoes a period of development and several iterations of review by the Internet community and revision based upon experience is adopted as a Standard by the appropriate body and is published. In practice, the process is more complicated, due to (1) the difficulty of creating specifications of high technical quality; (2) the need to consider the interests of all the affected parties; (3) the importance of establishing widespread community consensus; and (4) the difficulty of evaluating the utility of a particular specification for the Internet community. The goals of the Internet Standards Process are:
- Technical excellence;
- prior implementation and testing;
- clear, concise, and easily understood documentation;
- openness and fairness; and 
- timeliness.
The goal of technical competence, the requirement for prior implementation and testing, and the need to allow all interested parties to comment all require significant time and effort. The Internet Standards Process is intended to balance these conflicting goals. The process is believed to be as short and simple as possible without sacrificing technical excellence, thorough testing before adoption of a standard, or openness and fairness.

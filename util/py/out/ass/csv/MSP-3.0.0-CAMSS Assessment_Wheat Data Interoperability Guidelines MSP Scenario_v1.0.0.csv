The most relevant evidence of the market acceptance of is the adoption of the Wheat Data Interoperability Guidelines by WheatIS , an International Wheat Information System that provides a single-access web base system to seamlessly access to a wealth of distributed wheat-related data resources. The WheatIS relies on several data nodes which are representatives of the most important players in wheat research. 
Other organisations which implemented the specification are:
• USDA ARS and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
• EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute
• Australian Center for Plant Functional Genomics
• The Genome Analysis Center
• Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS), Helmholtz Center Munich
• INRIA URGI Adoption of the Wheat Data Interoperability Guidelines
• Rothamsted Research
• James Hutton Institute
• CIMMYT Wheat program
• Creation of a Query interface for phenotyping data
The wide implementation of the specification by these organisations demonstrate that the specification is widely accepted by the very specific market it addresses, the exchange of wheat-related data.

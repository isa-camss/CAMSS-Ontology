PM2 incorporates elements from a wide range of globally accepted project management best practices, captured in standards and methodologies. Then, it can be said that OpenPM2 is a commonly accepted business process modelling specification. 

Moreover, it has been commonly used for the development of projects at European Institutions over time and with its openness, all interested groups can be involved in the development of projects and the design of business processes while doing them efficiently.

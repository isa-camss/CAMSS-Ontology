# CAMSS Utilities - RML mappers

## <center>Transformation of the CAMSS Assessments, from spread-sheets to RDF-OWL</center>

Simple examples of how the CAMSS Assessments, once extracted into CSV files can be transformed into 
RDF TTL files using the specification 'RML.io' and the java tool 'rmlmapper'.

Each example comes accompanied with a Jupyter Notebook showing one way of launching the rmlmapper jar main class 
from Python.
